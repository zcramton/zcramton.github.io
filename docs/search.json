The final project was a collaborative river reach assessment based on data released by the City of Fort Collins.\n Poudre River Reach Assessment \n\n\n\nSpring 2025\n\nQuantitative Reasoning for Ecosystem Science- ESS 330\nIn the spring of 2025 I took a class on quantitative reasoning based in R. The course focused on applying instruction on coding in R to applications in statistics and data science.\n\nBuilding a project website:\n\nIn this assignment I built a personal website with Github Pages.\nIncludes a github repo for access to all the code.\nBegan reformatting file management across my personal systems.\nInvolved extensive troubleshooting and became familiar with R and Terminal syntax.\n\n\n\nOther Lab Projects\nLab 2: Minnesota Tree Growth - Examined forestry data from Minnesota to learn how to use the dplyr package. - Used functions like slice(), filter(), arrange(), select(), mutate(), rename() and summarize to manipulate these data.\nLab 3: COVID-19\n\nExplored the New York Times COVID-19 data using r.\nUsed tidyverse and flextable packages to organize and display data.\nUsed the zoo package to calculate rolling averages.\n\nLab 4: LTER Statistics In R\n\nUsed R to explore data from the National Science Foundation Long Term Ecological Research Network.\nUsed r packages including tidyverse, ggpubr, car and visdat to conduct statistical tests and display the data in the lterdatasampler package.\n\n\n\n\nSustainability Science - ESS 312\nIn this course I will be completing a research project exploring impacts and perceptions of obstacles to sustainable transportation in and around the campus of CSU Fort Collins. Update expected April 2025.\n\n\nLife Cycle Assessment for Sustainability - ESS 555\nIn this course I will be completing a comparative LCA. Update expected March 2025."
