### Fall 2024

#### Watershed Sustainability - WR204

In the fall of 2024 I took a class on watershed science. The final project was a collaborative river reach assessment based on data released by the City of Fort Collins.

### Spring 2025

#### Quantitative Reasoning for Ecosystem Science- ESS 330

In the spring of 2025 I took a class on quantitative reasoning based in R. The course focused on applying instruction on coding in R to applications in statistics and data science.

##### [Building a project website:](https://zachary.cramton.com){target="_blank"}

-   In this assignment I built a personal website with Github Pages.
-   Includes a github repo for access to all the code.
-   Began reformatting file management across my personal systems.
-   Involved extensive troubleshooting and became familiar with R and Terminal syntax.

  The rest of the work completed for this class can be found on the github pages site I created for the course. Please use the link in the heading for this subsection to go to the course site.

#### Sustainability Science - ESS 312

  In this course I am conducting a research project exploring impacts and perceptions the Starship food delivery robots used by Grubhub to deliver food from the dining halls and student center around campus. This research conducted throughout the remainder of the 2025 Spring semester, will interview students, staff, and faculty in the Warner College of Natural Resources to collect initial impressions of the Starship robots in the months after their January 2025 introduction. The goal of the report is to produce a word or phrase bank for future Q-methodology research in addition to forming a baseline understanding of opinions of within the College of Natural Resources.

#### Life Cycle Assessment for Sustainability - ESS 555

In this course I will be completing a comparative LCA assessing the sustainability of liquid hand soap packaging. The project is going to be conducted in three main phases:

-   [Life Cycle Inventory Report](media/ess555_lci_report.pdf){target="_blank"}
-   Life Cycle Impact Assessment (Update planned: May 2025)
  
##### Excerpt from the Life Cycle Inventory Report:
  
  In recent years consumers have demanded more sustainable products and
practices from the companies they purchase from. This is most apparent in the household soap industry. There have been several innovations like detergent sheets claiming to make the soap more sustainable by reducing the impact of transportation. However, less change has occurred in the hand soap space. The changes that have occurred focus on the container rather than the soap product itself.

  Similarly, multiple studies have been conducted on the sustainability differences between soap types including a comparison between liquid and bar soaps (Witlox et al., 2015) and different bio-detergents (Villota-Paz et al.). Comparative LCAs have been completed on different soap dispenser types (Coppini et al., 2017) and laundry detergent packaging methods (Kim & Park, 2020). The publicly available information on soap refill packaging is limited to companies with a vested interest in selling their product like Zacros, a company oƯering refill pouches which claim to be the most sustainable option (Keane & Petlack, 2022). Given the lack of publicly available information on the sustainability of liquid hand soap packaging this assessment seeks to provide consumers with a life cycle inventory (LCI) from a source unaƯiliated with the industry.
  
  The goal of this life cycle inventory is to compare the environmental sustainability of liquid soap refills packaged in plastic bottles versus soap refill bags, which are marketed as a more sustainable alternative. This assessment aims to provide household consumers with information on the environmental impacts of these liquid soap packaging options, helping environmentally conscious shoppers make informed purchasing decisions. Environmental impact categories such as greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions as well as energy and water consumption will be considered during this inventory. The results of this comparative inventory will be publicly disclosed.
