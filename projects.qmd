### Fall 2024

#### Watershed Sustainability - WR204

In the fall of 2024 I took a class on watershed science. The final project was a collaborative river reach assessment based on data released by the City of Fort Collins.

### Spring 2025

#### Quantitative Reasoning for Ecosystem Science- ESS 330

In the spring of 2025 I took a class on quantitative reasoning based in R. The course focused on applying instruction on coding in R to applications in statistics and data science. I found this class to be one of my most valuable classes so far, giving me a solid base of knowledge for future coding, web design and data analytics projects.

##### [Building a personal website:](https://zachary.cramton.com){target="_blank"}

-   For this class I built a personal website with Github Pages.
-   Created and managed a github repo for access to all the code.
-   Began reformatting file management across my personal systems.
-   Involved extensive troubleshooting and became familiar with R and Terminal syntax.

##### Coursework:

The rest of the work completed for this class can be found on the github pages site I created for the coursework. It can be found on [this site](https://zachary.cramton.com/csu_ess_330/) also built with Github Pages.

#### Sustainability Science - ESS 312

In this course I conducted a research project exploring impacts and perceptions the Starship food delivery robots used by Grubhub to deliver food from the dining halls and student center around campus. This research conducted throughout the 2025 Spring semester, interviewed students, staff, and faculty in the Warner College of Natural Resources to collect initial impressions of the Starship robots in the months after their January 2025 introduction. 

This report collected words and phrases for future Q-methodology research in addition to forming a baseline understanding of opinions of within the College of Natural Resources. Our research showed, at best, neutral feeling regarding the food delivery robots with negative undertones. Most of the negative feedback related to questions of inefficient spending, more traffic and obstacles on the sidewalks and at intersections as well as a general lack of need.

#### Life Cycle Assessment for Sustainability - ESS 555

In this course I completed a comparative LCA assessing the sustainability of two liquid hand soap packaging options. The project was conducted in three main phases: 
- [Goal & Scope Report](media/ess555_g+s_report.pdf){target="_blank"} 
- [Life Cycle Inventory Report](media/ess555_lci_report.pdf){target="_blank"} 
- [Life Cycle Impact Assessment](media/ess555_final_report){target="_blank"}

The comparative LCA resulted in mixed impacts between conventional PET bottles with PP caps and composite laminate pouches. That said, my assessment did not align with the claims of significant sustainability improvements made by refill pouch manufacturers based on my predefined system assumptions and constraints. This result may differ in a different scenario, particularly with a more complex logistics system. Throughout the course, I learned how to use OpenLCA and conduct life cycle assessments including sourcing data and defining parameters for the assessment.
