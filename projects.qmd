### Spring 2025

#### Quantitative Reasoning for Ecosystem Science- ESS 330

In the spring of 2025 I took a class on quantitative reasoning based in R. The course focused on applying instruction on coding in R to applications in statistics and data science.

##### [Building a project website:](https://zcramton.github.io){target="_blank"}

-   In this assignment I built a personal website with Github Pages.
-   Includes a github repo for access to all the code.
-   Began reformatting file management across my personal systems.
-   Involved extensive troubleshooting and became familiar with R and Terminal syntax.

##### Other Lab Projects

Lab 2: Minnesota Tree Growth
-   Examined forestry data from Minnesota to learn how to use the dplyr package.
-   Used functions like slice(), filter(), arrange(), select(), mutate(), rename() and summarize to manipulate these data.

[Lab 3: COVID-19](https://zcramton.github.io/csu-ess-lab3/lab-03.html){target="_blank"}

-   Explored the New York Times COVID-19 data using r.
-   Used tidyverse and flextable packages to organize and display data.
-   Used the zoo package to calculate rolling averages.

[Lab 4: LTER Statistics In R](https://zcramton.github.io/csu-ess330-lab4/lab-04.html){target="_blank"}

-   Used R to explore data from the National Science Foundation Long Term Ecological Research Network.
-   Used r packages including tidyverse, ggpubr, car and visdat to conduct statistical tests and display the data in the lterdatasampler package.


#### Sustainability Science - ESS 312

In this course I will be completing a research project exploring impacts and perceptions of obstacles to sustainable transportation in and around the campus of CSU Fort Collins. Update expected April 2025.

#### Life Cycle Assessment for Sustainability - ESS 555

In this course I will be completing a comparative LCA. Update expected March 2025.
